Li
Like/Dislike
Works well even in environments with variations in illumination and movement
Reduces noise from illumination/impact of illumination variations, good results on MAHNOB HCI database
Better ROI due to facial landmarks from DRMF, tracking to resolve issue of rigid movement
Tested on their own dataset, MAHNOB HCI, and on person playing a game
Builds off Poh, Kwon, and Balakrishnan studies
Seems more complicated than Poh

Relevance
Was able to detect heart rate from videos recorded using an ipad camera

Challenges 
Understanding of Discriminative Response Map Fitting, Distance Regularized Level Set Evolution, OpenCV, Matlab 

Ways to Improve 
Improve ROI tracking to deal with more extreme head movements/turns

Poh
Like/Dislike
Able to obtain pulse from videos with minimal variation in environment
Doesnâ€™t handle changes that well
Seems easier for us than Li

Relevance
Was able to detect heart rate from videos recorded using a basic webcam

Challenges
Understanding of OpenCV, ICA

Ways to Improve
Better ROI, rectangle from viola jones and classifier sometimes includes non face pixels
Use mask similar to in Li, omit eyes
