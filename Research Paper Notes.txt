2017 PhO2 Nam Bui


Like/Dislike
-Physical attribute not related, would be a large part of time but not used in final project
-Uses blood oxygen level not heart rate
-Uses phone pressed on chest, focuses more on depth so no knowledge of facial mapping is learned
-Depends on how hard pressed against skin
-It can be used live for long amounts of time


Relevance
-Lacks any specific relevance besides the mobile health connection, probably some similar sets of skills used but many skills needed for the final project are not used


Challenges 
-Creating a physical attribute
-A lot of challenges of the project are unrelated to the final project(how hard one is pushing) 


Improvement
-No mention of different skin colors or skin thickness, probably some sort of error generated that could be removed


HemaApp


Likes/Dislikes
-Hemoglobin measurement, not heart rate
-Lots of the project is analysis of the measurements of Hemoglobin, this is completely unrelated
-Noninvasive
-Physical attribute again, easier to make
-Physical attribute deals with problems in smartphone camera, relevant to final project


Relevance
-Blood oxygen instead of heart rate but this time more relevant challenges




Challenges
-App development
-Physical blood collection(probably a database needs to be used)


Improvement
-Physical attribute seems promising but it really had a small significant impact so extending functionality and making the cameras light range wider would greatly improve the project and be directly relevant to our project


 Seismo 


Likes/Dislikes
-Blood pressure, again not heart rate
-Physical data collection done over a long period of time(would have to use a database for this likely)
-2 out of 9 members in the final test didn't even get a final calculation
-Large amounts of noise filtration, would not be relevant to our project


Relevance
-Very little relevance, different software and more physical approach to finding blood pressure


Challenges
-Noise reduction, especially extending the error cancellation of these researchers
-No pre existing software is used to help, most would be created by us


Improvement
-2 out of the 9 in the final test had data to noisy to get a final blood pressure from, this should be investigated and changed
